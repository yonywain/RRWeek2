- interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken.  

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

**Main objectives:**   
1. What is mean total number of steps taken per day?  
2. What is the average daily activity pattern?  
3. Imputing missing values: dealing with missing values (NA) using several steps.  
4. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
